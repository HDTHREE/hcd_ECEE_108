/*So basically you need to add additional default cases for 
whatver range of fibancci sequences you want. You can store
a list of values so that the when calculating large n values of the nth 
value in the series. Whenever n is big, the method/algorithm will not
need to recur all the way down to n = 1, n-1=0. Adding two stored values
will allow the pogram to only need to recur down to those values.
